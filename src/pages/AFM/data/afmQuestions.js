    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: `**Analysis of Situation III:**
- Exercise Price: 300
- Spot Price: 400
- Action: **Lapsed**

Since the option lapsed when Spot > Exercise:
- A **Call option** would be exercised (profit available)
- A **Put option** would lapse (no benefit to sell at 300 when market is 400)

**Therefore:** This is a **PUT option**

**Profit/Loss:**
Option lapsed → Loss = Premium paid = **₹(25)**`,

    explanation: `**Interest Rate Cap Settlement:**

Cap Rate (Strike): 9%
Actual Rate: 11%
Notional Principal: ₹2,00,00,000

**Compensation Calculation:**
Since Actual Rate (11%) > Cap Rate (9%), the cap is exercised.

Compensation = Principal × (Actual Rate - Cap Rate)
= ₹2,00,00,000 × (11% - 9%)
= ₹2,00,00,000 × 2%

|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| 0.20 | -5 | 15 |
| 0.50 | 10 | 25 |
| 0.30 | 15 | -10 |

You are required to:

(i) Calculate the risk and return of investment in individual shares.

(ii) Compare the risk and return of these two shares with a portfolio of these shares in equal proportions.

(iii) Find out the proportion of each of the above shares to formulate a minimum risk portfolio.`,
    modelAnswer: `**SOLUTION: PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS**

---

**PART (i): Risk and Return of Individual Shares**

**Expected Return Calculation:**

**X Ltd.:**
E(Rx) = (0.20 × -5) + (0.50 × 10) + (0.30 × 15)
E(Rx) = -1 + 5 + 4.5 = **8.50%**

**Y Ltd.:**
E(Ry) = (0.20 × 15) + (0.50 × 25) + (0.30 × -10)
E(Ry) = 3 + 12.5 - 3 = **12.50%**

**Variance Calculation:**

| Prob | X | (X-X̄) | (X-X̄)² | P×(X-X̄)² | Y | (Y-Ȳ) | (Y-Ȳ)² | P×(Y-Ȳ)² |
|------|---|-------|---------|----------|---|-------|---------|----------|

| 0.30 | 15 | 6.50 | 42.25 | 12.675 | -10 | -22.50 | 506.25 | 151.875 |
| | | | **σ²x** | **50.25** | | | **σ²y** | **231.25** |

**Standard Deviation:**
- σx = √50.25 = **7.09%**
- σy = √231.25 = **15.21%**

**PART (ii): Portfolio Risk and Return (50:50)**

**Covariance Calculation:**

| Prob | (X-X̄) | (Y-Ȳ) | (X-X̄)(Y-Ȳ) | P × Product |
|------|-------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 0.20 | -13.50 | 2.50 | -33.75 | -6.75 |
| 0.50 | 1.50 | 12.50 | 18.75 | 9.375 |
| 0.30 | 6.50 | -22.50 | -146.25 | -43.875 |
| | | | **Cov(X,Y)** | **-41.25** |

**Portfolio Return:**
E(Rp) = (0.5 × 8.50) + (0.5 × 12.50) = **10.50%**

**Portfolio Variance:**
σ²p = (0.5)²(50.25) + (0.5)²(231.25) + 2(0.5)(0.5)(-41.25)
σ²p = 12.563 + 57.813 - 20.625 = **49.75**

**Portfolio Standard Deviation:**
σp = √49.75 = **7.05%**

**Comparison Table:**

| Measure | X Ltd. | Y Ltd. | Portfolio |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Return | 8.50% | 12.50% | 10.50% |
| Risk (σ) | 7.09% | 15.21% | **7.05%** |
| Return/Risk | 1.20 | 0.82 | **1.49** |

**Conclusion:** Portfolio has LOWER risk than both individual stocks due to negative covariance!

---

**PART (iii): Minimum Risk Portfolio**

**Formula:**
Wy = (σ²x - CovXY) / (σ²x + σ²y - 2×CovXY)

**Calculation:**
Wy = (50.25 - (-41.25)) / (50.25 + 231.25 - 2(-41.25))
Wy = 91.50 / 364 = **0.2514 or 25.14%**

**Optimal Weights:**
- **X Ltd. = 74.86% (≈75%)**
- **Y Ltd. = 25.14% (≈25%)**

**Minimum Portfolio Risk:**
σ²p(min) = (0.75)²(50.25) + (0.25)²(231.25) + 2(0.75)(0.25)(-41.25)
σ²p(min) = 28.27 + 14.45 - 15.47 = **27.25**
σp(min) = √27.25 = **5.22%**`,

    question: `PQ Ltd. expects sales of ₹100 lakhs in Year 1. The same will increase by ₹20 lakhs per year over the next four years. At the end of 5 years the project would be wound up. 

Details:
- Depreciation: 20% p.a. on straight line method
- Expenses excluding depreciation: 40% of sales
- No salvage value of plant
- Corporate Tax rate: 30%

PQ Ltd. proposes to invest in the plant an amount where the Net Present Value will be Zero.

Calculate the investment which can be made in the plant.`,
    modelAnswer: `**SOLUTION: CAPITAL BUDGETING - ZERO NPV INVESTMENT**

---

**STEP 1: Calculate Expected Sales and Cash Flows**

| Year | Sales (₹ Lakhs) | Expenses @40% | Contribution |
|------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | 100 | 40 | 60 |
| 2 | 120 | 48 | 72 |
| 3 | 140 | 56 | 84 |
| 4 | 160 | 64 | 96 |
| 5 | 180 | 72 | 108 |

---

**STEP 2: Set Up Cash Flow Equation**

Let **P** = Cost of Plant (Investment)

Depreciation per year = P × 20% = **0.20P**

**Annual Profit Before Tax (PBT):**

| Year | Contribution | Less: Depreciation | PBT |
|------|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| 1 | 60 | 0.20P | 60 - 0.20P |
| 2 | 72 | 0.20P | 72 - 0.20P |
| 3 | 84 | 0.20P | 84 - 0.20P |
| 4 | 96 | 0.20P | 96 - 0.20P |
| 5 | 108 | 0.20P | 108 - 0.20P |

---

**STEP 3: Calculate After-Tax Cash Flows**

**Tax = 30% of PBT**
**PAT = PBT × (1 - 0.30) = 0.70 × PBT**
**Cash Flow = PAT + Depreciation**

| Year | PBT | Tax @30% | PAT | Add: Dep | Cash Flow |
|------|-----|----------|-----|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 60-0.20P | 18-0.06P | 42-0.14P | 0.20P | 42+0.06P |
| 2 | 72-0.20P | 21.6-0.06P | 50.4-0.14P | 0.20P | 50.4+0.06P |
| 3 | 84-0.20P | 25.2-0.06P | 58.8-0.14P | 0.20P | 58.8+0.06P |
| 4 | 96-0.20P | 28.8-0.06P | 67.2-0.14P | 0.20P | 67.2+0.06P |
| 5 | 108-0.20P | 32.4-0.06P | 75.6-0.14P | 0.20P | 75.6+0.06P |

**Total Cash Inflows = 294 + 0.30P**

---

**STEP 4: Apply Zero NPV Condition**

For NPV = 0 (without discounting):

Sum of Cash Inflows = Initial Investment

294 + 0.30P = P

294 = P - 0.30P

294 = 0.70P

**P = 294 / 0.70 = ₹420 Lakhs**

---

**VERIFICATION:**

| Year | Cash Flow |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | 42 + 0.06(420) = 42 + 25.2 = 67.2 |
| 2 | 50.4 + 25.2 = 75.6 |
| 3 | 58.8 + 25.2 = 84.0 |
| 4 | 67.2 + 25.2 = 92.4 |
| 5 | 75.6 + 25.2 = 100.8 |
| **Total** | **420.0** |

✓ Total Cash Inflows = Investment = ₹420 Lakhs

**ANSWER: Investment in Plant = ₹420 Lakhs**`,

    question: `XY Ltd. is interested in expanding operations and planning to install a unit in US requiring $15 million (net of issue expenses). Floatation cost is 3%. To finance, it proposes to issue GDRs.

Additional Information:
- Expected market price at issue: ₹350 (Face Value ₹100)
- 3 shares underlie each GDR, priced at 6% discount to market
- Expected Exchange Rate: ₹84/$
- Expected dividend: 10% with growth rate of 8%

Calculate:
(i) Number of GDRs to be issued
(ii) Cost of GDR to XY Ltd.`,
    modelAnswer: `**SOLUTION: GDR ISSUE AND COST CALCULATION**

---

**GIVEN DATA:**
- Net Funds Required: $15 million
- Floatation Cost: 3%
- Market Price per Share: ₹350
- Face Value: ₹100
- Shares per GDR: 3
- Discount on GDR: 6%
- Exchange Rate: ₹84/$
- Dividend Rate: 10% on Face Value
- Growth Rate: 8%

---

**PART (i): Number of GDRs to be Issued**

**Step 1: Calculate Gross Issue Size**
Gross Issue = Net Funds / (1 - Floatation Cost)
Gross Issue = $15 million / 0.97
**Gross Issue = $15.464 million**

**Step 2: Calculate Issue Price per GDR**
GDR Price = (Market Price × Shares per GDR) × (1 - Discount)
GDR Price = (₹350 × 3) × 0.94
GDR Price = ₹1,050 × 0.94
**GDR Price = ₹987**

**Step 3: Convert to USD**
GDR Price in $ = ₹987 / ₹84
**GDR Price = $11.75**

**Step 4: Calculate Number of GDRs**
Number of GDRs = Gross Issue / Price per GDR
Number of GDRs = $15.464 million / $11.75
**Number of GDRs = 1.316085 million ≈ 13,16,085 GDRs**

---

**PART (ii): Cost of GDR to XY Ltd.**

**Step 1: Calculate Dividend per GDR**
Dividend per Share = 10% of ₹100 = ₹10
Dividend per GDR = ₹10 × 3 shares = **₹30**

**Step 2: Calculate Net Proceeds per GDR**
Net Proceeds = GDR Price × (1 - Floatation Cost)
Net Proceeds = ₹987 × 0.97
**Net Proceeds = ₹957.39**

**Step 3: Apply Cost of Equity Formula (Gordon Model)**

Cost of GDR (Ke) = (D₁ / P₀) + g

Where:
- D₁ = Dividend per GDR = ₹30
- P₀ = Net Proceeds = ₹957.39
- g = Growth rate = 8%

**Ke = (30 / 957.39) + 0.08**
**Ke = 0.0313 + 0.08**
**Ke = 0.1113 or 11.13%**

| Gross Issue Size | $15.464 million |
